# Reactive Design Patterns

This project contains some tests and implementations of the patterns exposed in the "Reactive Design Patterns" book [LINK](https://www.manning.com/books/reactive-design-patterns).

My idea doing this is to fully understand the patterns and learn their pros and cons by having a full hands-on
experience. To do so I have implemented everything from scratch, trying to avoid external libraries and tools as much as
possible. I tried to implement them following the ideas and architecture proposed in the text as much as possible,
although sometimes there has been necessary to modify minor stuff because of the characteristics of the chosen
technology.
